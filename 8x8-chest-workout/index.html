<p>Should you opt for a bodybuilding split, stick to three or four exercises for the larger muscle groups like legs, chest, and back. Vince gironda 8x8 workout example exercise movementsetsreps bench press to neck (ss1)48 v bar dips48 chin ups to sternum (ss2)48 wide grip pulldowns (ss2)48 lateral raises (ss3)48 dumbbell swings (ss3)48 above is an example of an 8x8 chest, back, and shoulders workout.

The vince gironda inspired 8x8 workout. The workout is known as the 8×8 workout and was (and still is) a popular bodybuilding routine to fine tune muscular imbalance for improved aesthetics, as well as improving cardiovascular health due to the high volume. The workouts are brutal, so be sure to give your body enough time to recover so you can go hard the next time you�re in the gym. The two chest exercises vince recommended the most was the neck press with a wide grip and very wide grip dips and very wide reverse grip dips. I�ve never been more sore in my biceps than with this workout.</p>

<p>Smaller areas like the biceps, triceps, and calves would only need two movements each. The muscles in both of those muscles, however, do not stretch to a similar degree in the full chest workout.

<p>So he actually recommended using less than 60 seconds of rest. Implement this plan by training for two days and then taking two complete rest days.
