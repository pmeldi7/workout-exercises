<h3 id="well-if-you-are-targeting-weight-loss-then-it-will-definitely-be-useful-because-green-tea-has-been-proven-to-be-a-good-fat-burner">Well if you are targeting weight loss, then it will definitely be useful because green tea has been proven to be a good fat burner.</h3><p>Im looking for a little boost before my workouts. If you have tried it let me know your results with it and what type of green tea you take.
