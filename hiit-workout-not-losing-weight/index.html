Good News HIIT Isn�t The Best Way to Lose Weight Eat From eatthis.com</p>
<p>Celebrity fitness trainer jillian michaels described cardio as the least efficient form of exercise for weight loss because it is not metabolic, meaning it doesn�t cause the body to continue to burn calories post workout.

Weight training can be used to lose weight, gain muscle, be stronger, be faster. Interval exercises can include running sprints alternating with light jogging or rest periods.</p>

But the truth is that you can lose weight faster with less work because the exercise you’re committing to has greater intensity. Then, start the first block of the workout.</p>
