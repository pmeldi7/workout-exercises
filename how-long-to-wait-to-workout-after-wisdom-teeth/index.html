How long should i wait to exercise after wisdom teeth removal? I got my wisdom teeth out i think 3 or 4 years ago over christmas break when i was in high school and by the end of the break they were dissolved i believe.</p>
<h3 id="wisdom-tooth-extractions-are-not-subject-to-this-restriction-even-if-they-are-simple">Wisdom tooth extractions are not subject to this restriction, even if they are simple.</h3><p>I stayed away from the gym for 3 days, eating was also. But to be safe i would wait 3 weeks. ‘once you’ve had a tooth removed, there’s a clot that needs to form in the hole created within the first 24 hours. In most cases, you can resume normal activities after the first day, but it would be best to wait about a week. I had my bottom 2 wisdom teeth removed 4 days ago and have been recovering pretty well and have waited 4 days so far of no weight lifting. The patient should be allowed to fully recover.</p>
