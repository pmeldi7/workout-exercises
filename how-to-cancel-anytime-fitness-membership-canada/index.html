<p>Since each club is separately owned and maintained, any cancellation requests must be made directly with the club using their online cancellation request portal, as per the customer’s membership agreement. As each club is independently owned and operated, and each state has different cancellation policies, please review your membership agreement prior to contacting your home club. I picked up an injury and anytime fitness refused to cancel my membership in person, over the phone (even after asking me all my security questions), via email, or in writing via mail. Franchisees are the ones in charge of pricing, so expect that your local anytime fitness may not charge the same rates as those in other towns.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-have-lost-your-contract-contact-your-home-club-for-a-copy-or-for-specific-instructions-regarding-membership-cancellation">If you have lost your contract, contact your home club for a copy or for specific instructions regarding membership cancellation.</h3><p>As each club is independently owned and operated, and each state has different cancellation policies, please review your membership agreement prior to contacting your home club. Once you’ve found the desired club, their address, phone, email, and web information will be displayed. The common misconception is that if your plan isn’t 100% finished, they will charge an early termination fee or some other penalty for quitting before its completion; Just read the fine print, and you’ll know what to expect. Open your locker, and pick up your branded anytime fitness bag, when you close the door the boss should appear over your right shoulder.
