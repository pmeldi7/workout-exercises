IÔøΩm, like, 26 and in pretty decent health. Sure there‚Äôs the chance you‚Äôll have an massive heart attack due to all the stimulants (and the fact that you‚Äôre probably lifting more weight than you need to), but that‚Äôs a very rare occurrence. ‚Äúwhen you do a dry pre workout scoop for the first time knowing you don‚Äôt consume caffeine regularly and end up in the hospital for a heart attack,‚Äù portillo wrote. Briatney portillo posted a series of videos on her tiktok account in april, including some recorded from the hospital, warning people about the viral challenge.
