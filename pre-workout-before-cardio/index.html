<p>Boosts your motivation and energy it is one of the most important things to consider, especially if you are working on your cardio exercises. Fueling your body with the right food before a hard cardio session can improve your performance while you work out. Not just by helping your gains, it can be especially good for hiit workouts too. It’s there to help your muscle endurance.</p>
<h3 id="should-i-take-pre-workout-before-cardio">Should i take pre workout before cardio?</h3><p>Of course it can be used before running, or cardio training. Per workouts are more for lifting, i�d avoid it before any cardio activity. Fueling your body with the right food before a hard cardio session can improve your performance while you work out. It’s true that doing cardio first may fatigue your muscles, and doing strength first may affect your endurance afterward. When i would have morning practice from wrestling i would take a pre workout with about 350 mg of caffeine ( a little more than 2 scoops of c4) and personally i hated it, it made my heart race if i was doing really intensive cardio. Pre workout supplements can be used for any type of cardio, whether it’s steady state or hiit.</p>
