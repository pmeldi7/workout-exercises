This chapter concerns the rate of perceived exertion (rpe) system in reactive training. Rpe allows you to train to a specific intensity to meet the goals of a particular workout. Rpe is more easily understood visually with a chart (taken from our 6 day workout routine plan): Let’s say you’re running my minimal routine which is an adaptation of pavel tsatsouline’s fighter pullup program and you finished your 5 sets of pullups and pushups. For example, if rate of perceived exertion is 6 and the workout took 50 minutes to complete, the rpe load would be 300.</p>

<p>While heart rate (hr) is a popular way to measure exercise intensity, we prefer ratings of perceived exertion (rpe) and will explain why in this post.

<p>Rpe is how hard something feels to you at the time. Below is an example of a workout in a training log. For example, if rate of perceived exertion is 6 and the workout took 50 minutes to complete, the rpe load would be 300. In this example the athlete (jane) does her warmup, followed by a set or two.</p>

<p>Rpe is added to sets and reps to dictate the load used. Let’s say you’re running my minimal routine which is an adaptation of pavel tsatsouline’s fighter pullup program and you finished your 5 sets of pullups and pushups.

<p>Rpe is more easily understood visually with a chart (taken from our 6 day workout routine plan): If an rpe only program if is set up right and the lifter executes it reasonably well they shouldn’t be repeating the same workout for that long anyway.
