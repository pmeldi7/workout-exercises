<p>Prices do vary by location, so its best to go in to your local snap fitness gym to find out yours. Here’s why train tickets are so expensive. Snap fitness is a franchise and, as such, each gym is owned and operated slightly different. The gym also charges a $29 joining fee and $49 for an access card. Why is.</p>

<p>The gym also charges a $20.00 access card fee that is charged with your first billing period. Why is snap fitness so expensive?
